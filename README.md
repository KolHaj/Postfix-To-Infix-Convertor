# Postfix Expression to Infix Expression Conversion

The application takes input of a postfix expression value that has to be real numbers. The code uses a binary tree in handling specifically the postfix 
to infix notation conversion in the results field, and the process of the assembly is printed into a text file called "AssemblyFile.txt". 
The examples are provided in the resources' folder that can be used to test if the program works.

## Getting Started

The project is built using Java so using any IDE that supports Java will work and can be used to create a .jar file to run in the desktop. 
For the application to work you will need to use correctly formatted postfix expression with real number values and that will be used to convert
the postfix expression into an infix expression and create a text file.
